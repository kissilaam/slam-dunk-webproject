          <h1>What is Slam Dunk?</h1>

          <div class="about-text">
            <p>After being rejected by 100 girls, a teen delinquent decides to join the school's basketball team in hopes of conquering his latest crush – an avid basketball supporter.</p>

            <p>This simple comedic premise is the base for one of the most popular Japanese manga of all time. Twice voted by the Japanese public as the best manga of all time, Slam Dunk is still considered to be one of the best, most influential works in Japan and was largely responsible for the popularization of the sport in the country during the 1990's. Following a group of teenagers fighting to become national champions, Slam Dunk is a beautifully illustrated story about resilience, friendship, and finding one's passion that still resonates with today's audiences.</p>

                <h2>Hanamichi Sakuragi</h2>
                <p>Our main protagonist, Sakuragi is a freshman who decides to join the basketball team on a whim after finding out his crush, Haruko, loves basketball. A teenage delinquent, he is the leader of his own gang of troublemakers and is well-known for his strength, arrogance, short-temper and, most notably, his bright-red hair.</p>
                <p>During the course of the story, we follow his journey to master the basics of the sport while simultaneously demonstrating immense natural talent and drive.   Despite his lack of experience or skill, he quickly becomes an essential part of the team due to his aptitude, quick-learning, and the capacity to boost the team in crucial moments. He soon develops a defining rivalry with Rukawa, another freshman who is said to be one of the greatest young talents in Japan.</p>
                <p>Boasting himself “The Genius” and “The Rebound King” since the beginning, Sakuragi's story is one of growth through sport and companionship, as we follow his path from an immature, aggressive boy to becoming a trusted and reliable part of the team.</p>
