          <h1>What is Slam Dunk?</h1>

          <div class="about-text">
            <p>After being rejected by 100 girls, a teen delinquent decides to join the school's basketball team in hopes of conquering his latest crush – an avid basketball supporter. This simple comedic premise is the base for one of the most popular Japanese manga of all time. Twice-voted by the Japanese public as the best manga of all time, Slam Dunk is still considered to be one of the best, most influential works in Japan and was largely responsible for the popularization of the sport in the country during the 1990's. Following a group of teenagers fighting to become national champions, Slam Dunk is a beautifully illustrated story about resilience, friendship, and finding one's passion that still resonates with  audiences today.</p>

                    <p>Our main protagonist, Sakuragi is a freshman who joins the basketball team on a whim after finding out his crush, Haruko, loves the sport. A teenage delinquent, he is the leader of his own gang of troublemakers and is well-known for his strength, arrogance, short temper, and most notably, his bright-red hair.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the story, we follow his journey to master the basics of the sport while demonstrating immense natural talent and drive. Despite his lack of experience or skill, he quickly becomes an essential part of the team due to his aptitude, quick-learning, and the capacity to boost the team in crucial moments. He soon develops a defining rivalry with Rukawa, another freshman who is said to be one of the greatest young talents in Japan.</p>
                    <p>Boasting himself “The Genius” and “The Rebound King” from the beginning, Sakuragi's story is one of self-discovery, growth and companionship, as we follow his path from an immature, aggressive boy to a trusted and reliable part of the team.</p>

                    <p>The team captain and center, Akagi is also Haruko's older brother. In love with basketball from an early age, his goal is to be a national champion - a dream he's shared with his friend Kogure since they were freshman themselves. He has a long rivalry with Jun Uozumi, the captain and center of Ryonan's basketball team.
                    <p>Nicknamed "gori" by Sakuragi because of his size and sternness, Akagi is extremely disciplined but fiercely commited, loyal and reliable to his teammates and friends, known to be the pillar Shohoku stands on and an upstanding student and role-model. Despite Sakuragi's antics, Akagi sees his talent and effort and takes the rookie under his wing; his fast understanding of his new player ensures Sakuragi not only stays in line, but also maximizes his potential as an asset to the team.</p>

                  <div class="bio-text">
                    <p>An extremely talented freshman, Rukawa is en route to be one of Japan's best players. Despite his cold, aloof and unfriendly personality, he is highly regarded by his colleagues and rivals alike for his ability in the court. His only focus is in the sport, to which he dedicates himself completely aiming to become the best. Because of that, he is extremely sensitive to losing.</p>
                    <p>Rukawa is the team's ace player, often taking charge and carrying the score in times of need. Highly skilled, he can play both offense and defense and is often at his best when faced with a challenging opponent. He's also seen as handsome by the girls in school, attracting many female fans to the games (including Haruko herself).</p>
                    <p>Rukawa and Sakuragi develop an odd relationship characterized by Sakuragi's one-sided hatred and Rukawa's indiference. Despite this, Rukawa leaves an indelible mark in our protagonist and is, many times, the fuel that propels Sakuragi forward. </p>

After a quick missunderstanding, Miyagi becomes Sakuragi's best friend in the team, bonding over their shared bad luck with love and their quick temper (Miyagi is the second leg of the troublemakers tripod of Shohoku's team).</p>
                    <p>Miyagi also got into the team over a girl: Ayako, his best friend and the Shohoku's team manager. His personality highly compliments Sakuragi's and the two have many overlapping traits, such as arrogance, a bad reputation, good humor and goofiness when comfortable. Miyagi is sometimes shown as being insecure about his height as player, often being pitted against much taller opponents. </p>

It's only after a serious altercation with the basketball team where he's forced to confront his trauma and his idol, Shohoku's coach Anzai, that Mitsui finds his way back to the thing he loves the most.</p>
                    <p>Playing as a shooting guard, he works hard to regain his stamina and confidence and becomes one of Shohoku's most valuable players once more. Feeling like he let his friends down on his promise to help the team become national champions, Mitsui carries great guilt and is determined not to be the weak link he fears he is. An amazing 3-point-shooter, his long-distance shots are one of Shohoku's greatest trumps.</p>

                    <p>Even as support characters, they each have their own distinct personality and appearance. They're the most unserious characters in the series, cracking jokes at everyone's expenses and generally serving as comic relief and often as a window into Sakuragi's own thoughts and feelings. Mito, Sakuragi's right-hand man and best friend, is also the most serious and mature out of all five. </p>

Unafraid of Sakuragi's size and bad fame, Haruko is the first to make friends with him and to see his potential as a basketball player, convincing him to joint the team.</p>
                    <p>Haruko's inspiration in life is her big brother, whom she deeply respects and loves. She's also often seen with a group of friends who follow her around. Like most girls at school, she also has a crush on Rukawa (however unreciprocated).</p>

                    <p>Our main protagonist, Sakuragi is a freshman who decides to join the basketball team on a whim after finding out his crush, Haruko, loves basketball. A teenage delinquent, he is the leader of his own gang of troublemakers and is well-known for his strength, arrogance, short temper and, most notably, his bright-red hair.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the story, we follow his journey to master the basics of the sport while simultaneously demonstrating immense natural talent and drive. Despite his lack of experience or skill, he quickly becomes an essential part of the team due to his aptitude, quick-learning, and the capacity to boost the team in crucial moments. He soon develops a defining rivalry with Rukawa, another freshman who is said to be one of the greatest young talents in Japan.</p>
                    <p>Boasting himself “The Genius” and “The Rebound King” from the beginning, Sakuragi's story is one of growth through sport and companionship, as we follow his path from an immature, aggressive boy to trusted and reliable part of the team.</p>
